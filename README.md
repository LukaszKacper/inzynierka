# About the project
The application created as an engineering thesis for studies at the Lublin University of Technology. The aim of the project was to create a mobile application to manage finances, which as much as possible user needs. There are many applications for this purpose on the market, but in our opinion they are overkill and have many built-in functions which are cumbersome and the user does not use them fully. Therefore, our application focuses only on the most important aspects, which makes the application transparent and easy to use for any user.

### Built With

The application was built using these technologies:

* Flutter
* Dart
* Firebase
